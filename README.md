# OS-CLI
Linux-like Command Line Interpreter made in Java for the Operating Systems class.

The supported command are:
"ls", "cp", "mv", "rm", "pwd", "cat", "cd", "mkdir", "rmdir", "more", "args", "date", "help", "clear", and a custom "exit". If the console supports it, the application also outputs in a color that mimicks linux terminal.
